1.AI analyzer scripts
2 seperate scripts with different prompts
one for device splitting based on weather,  two for emmission leveling

Calculation for cost plan (cost-logic.tsx)
steps
1.Recieve Ai device split
2.Sort by device by use frequency (daily appear all days, weekends appears weekend, frequently maximum 3 days, rarely maximum 1 day)
3.Get user device watts and use hours and device priority
 for each day a device appear for use (do device watt x device hour for each device then sum all devices together
Example
assume I purchase a kilowatt for 36 naira and I have 4000 budget that is total 111.11kwh allocated for the month and 3.7kw/day = 133.2 naira per day
this is day 30 devices
hours will use this logic now (0.1 = 10 minutes - 0.5 50 minutes then 1 hour)
 freezer (300 watt use hour 8) = convert watt to kilowatt 300 = 0.3kw then do 0.3kw x 8 =  2.4kw = 86.4 naira
 tv (150 watt use hour 1) = convert watt to kilowatt 150 = 0.15kw then do 0.15kw x 1 =  0.15kw = 5.4 naira
 blender (40 watt use minute 20 ) = convert watt to kilowatt 40 = 0.04kw then do 0.04kw x 20/60(that's 1/3 hours) =  0.0133kw = 0.48 naira
 washing machine (200 watt use hour 2) = convert watt to kilowatt 200 = 0.2kw then do 0.3kw x 2 =  0.6kw = 21.6 naira
 phone (60 watt use hour 5) = convert watt to kilowatt 60 = 0.06kw then do 0.06kw x 5 =  0.3kw = 10.8 naira
 laptop (80 watt use hour 8) = convert watt to kilowatt 80 = 0.08kw then do 0.08kw x 8 =  0.64kw = 23.04 naira
 
sum up the day devices cost = 86.4 + 5.4 + 0.48 + 21.6 + 10.8 + 23.04 = 147.72

check if sum is greater than daily budget to check if trimming is needed
147.72 > 133.2 so trimming is needed
 
for trimming
1. check how many device are in the list and get the device with the highest cost
2. check the priority on the device 
	if priority is 5 trim price by 10 percent e.g 86.4 naira - 10% = 77.76
	if priority is 4 trim price by 15 percent
	if priority is 3 trim price by 20 percent
	if priority is 2 trim price by 30 percent
	if priority is 1 trim by 50 percent
for price reduction in each trim the use hour of that device is recalculated to match the cost
for each trim recalculate the cost and check if it's under budget
if it is we are good
if it is not check the list of devices again with (after that trim with the intial device)
check if there's a new device with the highest budget or that previous device is still the one with the highest budget
then perform the trimming again based on the priority logic stated above

trimming continues until we get a sum cost that is under budget for that day

2. Cost Calculation Steps
Receive AI device split
Sort by frequency (daily/weekends/frequently/rarely)
Calculate daily cost: 
(watts/1000) × hours × pricePerKwh
3. Trimming Logic (Priority-Based)
If daily cost > budget, trim highest cost device first
Trim percentages by priority:
Priority 5: -10%
Priority 4: -15%
Priority 3: -20%
Priority 2: -30%
Priority 1: -50%
Recalculate hours to match trimmed cost
Repeat until under budget
